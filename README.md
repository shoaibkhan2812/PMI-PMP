# Lesson 1: Business Environment

* Foundation
* Strategic Alignment
* Organizaional culter and change management
* Project Governance

**Project :**

<ins>Definition:</ins> A project is a "temporary" endeavour to create a unique product, service or result.
Projects have definite start and end date. The ultimate goal of a project is to add value to the organization/business operations.

The projects come to an end if the objectives have been met or cannot be met because of:

- Lack of business need
- Unavailability of funding
- Change in organizational priorities or strategies
- Change in the external environment

At this point the project is aborted.
<BR><BR>
<ins>**Reasons for Project Failure:** </ins> Following have been identified as the resaons for project failures

- Unclear or incorrect requirements
- Lack of control over cost and schdule
- Scope creep
- Limited involvement of sponsors in designing strategy and direction
- Inadequate project planning.
- Frequent changing project managers
- Unclear responsibilities and relationship among the project teams
- Lack of clarity on benefits and deliverables
- Poor change control
- Insufficient skills

Operations Management concerns with day to day running of business/service effectively.
Projects take input from operations team, work on the requirements and deliver it back to them. Operations don't have a fixed start or end date.

<ins>Project Management: </ins> Deals with a smaller objective. Part of a broader program or portfolio.
<BR><BR>
<ins>Program Management: </ins> Group of related projects, subsidiary programs and program activities managed in coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.
<BR><BR>
<ins>Portfolio Management: </ins> Collection of projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios and operations managed in a group to achieve strategic objectives.
<BR><BR>

A project may not nexessarily be a part of program or a portfolio. An independent project can exist.

**Project Management Life Cycle & Development Approach.**
* Plan-based approach
* Change-based approach
<BR><BR>
* **Plan-based:** Activities are completed in a linear fashion. Each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin.(Waterfall model). You make a plan and stick to it till the end.
  - Stop accepting the changes and start delivering, as quick as possible.
  - The value is realized at the end of the project
* **Change-based:** Agile model. This approach welcomes change in between and accomodates
  - Time-boxed cadence(iterations/sprints). Cadence literally means rhythm.
  - The value is delivered throughout the project.
